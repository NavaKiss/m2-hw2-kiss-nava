    <h1>Who is Nava Kiss?</h1>
    <h2>A Brief Introduction to One of Your Spring 2025 Students</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I currently work for Marine Corps Community Services at Camp Pendleton, a USMC base in Oceanside, CA. My husband and I moved here about 4 months ago from Pensacola, Florida, as he is currently a helicopter pilot with the Marines. One of the primary skills I employ at my job is photography, and I also currently host my own website for freelance work using the Content Management System and website builder Wix. If you're curious, you can visit it <a href="https://www.navakiss.com/" target="_blank">here!</a> However, I'm excited to learn more about producing websites with HTML for the following reasons: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>There are some features of my website I'm unhappy with and would like to change</li>
        <li>My current web host, Wix, allows users to customize features using HTML</li>
        <li>I will be recieving web training at my job next month, and whether or not coding is required, having the basics of HTML down will certainly put me a step ahead </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Below, you'll find a few examples of my work. </p>

    <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
    <p>I am someone that <strong>cherishes</strong> my work life balance, so I tend to fill my weekends and free time up with fun activites and pursue many hobbies (when I'm not doing homework, of course). Here's a few I've been enjoying recently!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Camping/backpacking</li>
        <li>Horseback riding</li>
        <li>SCUBA diving</li>
        <li>Running/going to the gym</li>
        <li>Line dancing</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Archery</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I also love to travel and have a goal to visit every U.S. state and National Park. I could talk for hours about the places I would like to visit or have been in the past, and getting to see and explore different places is one of my favorite things about the military lifestyle. For now, I hope you enjoyed this brief introduction!</p>
