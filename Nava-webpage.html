    <h1>Who is Nava Kiss?</h1>
    <h2>A Brief Introduction to One of Your Spring 2025 Students</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>I currently work for Marine Corps Community Services at Camp Pendleton, a USMC base in Oceanside, CA. One of the primary skills I employ at my job is photography, and I currently host my own website using the Content Management System and website builder Wix. If you're curious, you can visit it <a href="navakiss.com">here!</a> However, I'm excited to learn more about producing websites with HTML for the following reasons: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>There are some features of my website I'm unhappy with and would like to change</li>
        <li>My current web host, Wix, allows users to customize features using HTML</li>
        <li>I will be recieving web training at my job next month, and whether or not coding is required, having the basics of HTML down will certainly put me a step ahead <li>
    </ol>
    <p>Below, you'll find a few examples of my work: a Humpback whale from an underwater expedition, a "selfie" from a camping trip in South Dakota, and a portrait of my good friend Teresa. </p>

    <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
    <p>I am someone that <strong>cherishes</strong> my work life balance, so I tend to fill my weekends and free time up with fun activites and pursue many hobbies (when I'm not doing homework, of course). Here's a few I've been enjoying recently!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Camping/backpacking</li>
        <li>Horseback riding</li>
